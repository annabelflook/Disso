Abstract: A computer method has been devised to describe the theoretical dissolution rate of a polydisperse powder under non-sink conditions based on its percent weight particle size distribution. This method was used to estimate the particle size distribution of drug contained in 3 capsule formulations which differed only in the extent of milling of drug used to make the capsules. These distributions served to demonstrate the effect of milling on dissolution rate and were used to simulate their effect on the amount of drug absorbed orally.
